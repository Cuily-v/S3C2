This folder contains Matlab code (Refer to Li Chunguang's "A Structured Sparse Plus Structured Low-Rank Framework for Subspace Clustering and Completion") related to the following paper:
S3C2: A streamlined single cell RNA-Seq data analysis framework based on improved sparse subspace clustering

Our Matlab (>= 2018) code admits a few experimental usages and has not been extensively tested. 

The algorithm S3C2 is illustrated with an example in demo.m. The parameters in the example are given randomly.

The codes of the comparison algorithms in the article: SSC, SSSC, WSSC and SWSSC are refer to the relevant articles, and the SIMLR package was downloaded from Github (https://github. com/BatzoglouLabSU/SIMLR)

All comparison methods use the default parameters mentioned in the articles.
