This folder contains Matlab code related to the following paper:
S3C2: A streamlined single cell RNA-Seq data analysis framework based on improved sparse subspace clustering

Our Matlab (>= 2018) code admits a few experimental usages and has not been extensively tested. 

An example is illustrated in demo.m. The parameters in the example are obtained by simple examples.

The method of comparison in the article: the codes of SSC, SSSC, WSSC, SWSSC are from the author.

The SIMLR package was downloaded from Github (https://github.com/BatzoglouLabSU/SIMLR)

All comparison methods use the default parameters mentioned by their authors
